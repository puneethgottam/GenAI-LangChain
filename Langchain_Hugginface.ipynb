Some examples of generative AI models include deep learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as well as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.\\n\\nGenerative AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including entertainment, marketing, and design, by enabling the creation of personalized and unique content at scale.
